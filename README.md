# local-weather-app

A responsive webpage that displays the current weather based upon the user's location determined by HTML5 Geolocation. Connected to the freeCodeCamp Weather API at https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery/JSON. My fourth project completed for freecodecamp.com.
